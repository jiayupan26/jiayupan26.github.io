<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
I received my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Ohio State University in 2023.08. My graduate advisors are <a href="http://newslab.ece.ohio-state.edu">Prof. Ness B. Shroff</a>, an IEEE Fellow who makes fundamental contributions to the networking area, and Prof. Yin Sun who receives the NSF career award. Before that, I received my B.S. degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2017.07. My undergrad advisors are Prof. Xinbing Wang and Prof. Luoyi Fu. Starting from 2023.09, I am honored to join the School of Software Technology, Zhejiang University.     
<br><br>
My main research contributions in recent years are about network science. Specifically, I used some mathematical tools such as reinforcement learning, stopping rules to model various wireless network environments. For each environment, I obtained an exact but simple solution to optimize essential metrics, such as estimation error and age of information. My current research interest includes: (i) How to obtain similar solutions under complex networks, and (ii) How should these communication networks adapt to the widespread employment of large language model. 
<!-- I am an AI researcher specializing in the field of machine learning, with a primary focus on edge-cloud collaborative learning, multi-media analysis, and data mining. My research work aims to address the challenges associated with the seamless collaboration of heterogeneous models in edge devices and cloud servers. Through the design and evaluation of these models, I seek to improve the scalability, reliability, and real-time performance of machine learning systems in a wide range of applications. -->

<!-- A key component of my research is exploring novel algorithms and models for edge-cloud collaborative learning, which enables the seamless coordination between edge devices and cloud servers in distributed learning environments. Through the design and evaluation of these models, I seek to improve the scalability, reliability, and real-time performance of machine learning systems in a wide range of applications. -->
<!-- I have over 20 publications appeared in several top-tier conferences such as KDD, SIGIR, WWW, and ACMMM, and journals including TPAMI and TKDE. My research interests include edge-cloud collaborative learning, multi-media analysis, and data. Research models have been deployed in recommender systems of Mobile Taobao, Huwei Music, and Tencent News. -->
